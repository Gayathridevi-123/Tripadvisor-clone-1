🌍 TripAdvisor Website Clone

I created a TripAdvisor-inspired website using HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques. The project focuses on showcasing destinations, travel deals, and reviews in a clean and interactive layout.

✨ Features:

HTML Structure → Well-organized sections for header, navbar, destinations, offers, and footer.

CSS Animations → Smooth hover effects, fade-in transitions, and subtle scrolling animations to enhance user experience.

Flexbox Layout → Built with flex properties (flex-grow, flex-basis, flex-wrap) to maintain a structured and adaptive layout.

Responsive Design → Implemented media queries to ensure the website looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

Modern Styling → Used shadows, hover effects, and groove borders for an elegant UI.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

HTML5

CSS3 (Animations, Flexbox, Media Queries)

This project was mainly built to practice responsive web design and CSS animations while replicating the style of a popular travel platform.
